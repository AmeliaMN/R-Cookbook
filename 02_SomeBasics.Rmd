# Some Basics {#SomeBasics}

Introduction {-#intro-SomeBasics}
------------

The recipes in this chapter lie somewhere between problem-solving ideas
and tutorials. Yes, they solve common problems, but the Solutions
showcase common techniques and idioms used in most R code, including the
code in this cookbook. If you are new to R, we suggest skimming this
chapter to acquaint yourself with these idioms.

Printing Something to the Screen {#recipe-id017}
------------------

### Problem {-#problem-id017}

You want to display the value of a variable or expression.

### Solution {-#solution-id017}

If you simply enter the variable name or expression at the command
prompt, R will print its value. Use the `print` function for generic
printing of any object. Use the `cat` function for producing custom
formatted output.

### Discussion {-#discussion-id017}

It’s very easy to ask R to print something: just enter it at the command
prompt:

``` {r}
pi
sqrt(2)
```

When you enter expressions like that, R evaluates the expression and
then implicitly calls the `print` function. So the previous example is
identical to this:

``` {r}
print(pi)
print(sqrt(2))
```

The beauty of `print` is that it knows how to format any R value for
printing, including structured values such as matrices and lists:

``` {r}
print(matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4), 2, 2))
print(list("a", "b", "c"))
```

This is useful because you can always view your data: just `print` it.
You need not write special printing logic, even for complicated data
structures.

The `print` function has a significant limitation, however: it prints
only one object at a time. Trying to `print` multiple items gives this
mind-numbing error message:

``` {r, error = TRUE}
print("The zero occurs at", 2 * pi, "radians.")
```

The only way to `print` multiple items is to print them one at a time,
which probably isn’t what you want:

``` {r}
print("The zero occurs at")
print(2 * pi)
print("radians")
```

The `cat` function is an alternative to `print` that lets you concatenate multiple items into a continuous output:

``` {r}
cat("The zero occurs at", 2 * pi, "radians.", "\n")
```

Notice that `cat` puts a space between each item by default. You must
provide a newline character (`\n`) to terminate the line.

The `cat` function can print simple vectors, too:

``` {r}
fib <- c(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34)
cat("The first few Fibonacci numbers are:", fib, "...\n")
```

Using `cat` gives you more control over your output, which makes it
especially useful in R scripts that generate output consumed by others. A serious limitation, however, is that
it cannot print compound data structures such as matrices and lists.
Trying to `cat` them only produces another mind-numbing message:

``` {r, error = TRUE}
cat(list("a", "b", "c"))
```

Setting Variables {#recipe-id016}
-----------------

### Problem {-#problem-id016}

You want to save a value in a variable.

### Solution {-#solution-id016}

Use the assignment operator (`<-`). There is no need to declare your
variable first:

``` {r}
x <- 3
```

### Discussion {-#discussion-id016}

Using R in “calculator mode” gets old pretty fast. Soon you will want to
define variables and save values in them. This reduces typing, saves
time, and clarifies your work.

There is no need to declare or explicitly create variables in R. Just
assign a value to the name and R will create the variable:

``` {r}
x <- 3
y <- 4
z <- sqrt(x^2 + y^2)
print(z)
```

Notice that the assignment operator is formed from a less-than character
(`<`) and a hyphen (`-`) with no space between them.

When you define a variable at the command prompt like this, the variable
is held in your workspace. The workspace is held in the computer’s main
memory but can be saved to disk. The variable
definition remains in the workspace until you remove it.

R is a *dynamically typed language*, which means that we can change a
variable’s data type at will. We could set `x` to be numeric, as just
shown, and then turn around and immediately overwrite that with (say) a
vector of character strings. R will not complain:

``` {r}
x <- 3
print(x)

x <- c("fee", "fie", "foe", "fum")
print(x)
```

In some R functions you will see assignment statements that use the
strange-looking assignment operator `<<-`:

``` {r}
x <<- 3
```

That forces the assignment to a global variable rather than a local
variable. Scoping is a bit, well, out of scope for this discussion, however.

In the spirit of full disclosure, we will reveal that R also supports two
other forms of assignment statements. A single equals sign (`=`) can be
used as an assignment operator. A rightward
assignment operator (`->`) can be used anywhere the leftward assignment
operator (`<-`) can be used (but with the arguments reversed):

```{r}
foo <- 3
print(foo)
```

```{r}
5 -> fum
print(fum)
```

We recommend that you avoid these as well. The equals-sign assignment is easily confused with the test for
equality. The rightward assignment can be useful in certain contexts, but it can be confusing to those not used to seeing it.

See also the help page for the `assign` function.

Listing Variables {#recipe-id091}
-----------------

### Problem {-#problem-id091}

You want to know what variables and functions are defined in your
workspace.

### Solution {-#solution-id091}

Use the `ls` function. Use `ls.str` for more details about each
variable. You can also see your variables and functions in the Environment pane in RStudio, shown in Figure \@ref(fig:environmentPanel).

### Discussion {-#discussion-id091}

The `ls` function displays the names of objects in your workspace:
```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
rm(list = ls())
```
``` {r}
x <- 10
y <- 50
z <- c("three", "blind", "mice")
f <- function(n, p) sqrt(p * (1 - p) / n)
ls()
```

Notice that `ls` returns a vector of character strings in which each
string is the name of one variable or function. When your workspace is
empty, `ls` returns an empty vector, which produces this puzzling
output:

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
rm(list = ls())
```
``` {r}
ls()
```

That is R’s quaint way of saying that `ls` returned a zero-length vector
of strings; that is, it returned an empty vector because nothing is
defined in your workspace.

If you want more than just a list of names, try `ls.str`; this will also
tell you something about each variable:
``` {r}
x <- 10
y <- 50
z <- c("three", "blind", "mice")
f <- function(n, p) sqrt(p * (1 - p) / n)
ls.str()
```

The function is called `ls.str` because it is both listing your
variables and applying the `str` function to them, showing their
structure (see Recipe \@ref(recipe-id202), ["Revealing the Structure of an Object"](#recipe-id202)).

Ordinarily, `ls` does not return any name that begins with a dot (`.`).
Such names are considered hidden and are not normally of interest to
users. (This mirrors the Unix convention of not listing files whose
names begin with a dot.) You can force `ls` to list everything by setting
the `all.names` argument to `TRUE`:

``` {r}
ls()
ls(all.names = TRUE)
```

The Environment pane in RStudio also hides objects with names that begin with a dot. 

### See Also {-#see_also-id091}

See Recipe \@ref(recipe-id075), ["Deleting Variables"](#recipe-id075), for deleting variables and
Recipe \@ref(recipe-id202), ["Revealing the Structure of an Object"](#recipe-id202), for inspecting your variables.

Deleting Variables {#recipe-id075}
------------------

### Problem {-#problem-id075}

You want to remove unneeded variables or functions from your workspace
or to erase its contents completely.

### Solution {-#solution-id075}

Use the `rm` function.

### Discussion {-#discussion-id075}

Your workspace can get cluttered quickly. The `rm` function removes,
permanently, one or more objects from the workspace:

``` {r, error=TRUE}
x <- 2 * pi
x
rm(x)
x
```

There is no “undo”; once the variable is gone, it’s gone.

You can remove several variables at once:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
rm(x, y, z)
```

You can even erase your entire workspace at once. The `rm` function has
a `list` argument consisting of a vector of names of variables to
remove. Recall that the `ls` function returns a vector of variables
names; hence, you can combine `rm` and `ls` to erase everything:

``` {r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
x <- 10
y <- 50
z <- c("three", "blind", "mice")
f <- function(n, p) sqrt(p * (1 - p) / n)
```
``` {r}
ls()
rm(list = ls())
ls()
```

Alternatively you could click the broom icon at the top of the Environment pane in RStudio, shown in Figure \@ref(fig:environmentPanel).

```{r environmentPanel, fig.cap='Environment pane in RStudio', echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("images_v2/environment.png")
```

Never put `rm(list=ls())` into code you share with others, such as a
library function or sample code sent to a mailing list or Stack Overflow. Deleting all the
variables in someone else’s workspace is worse than rude and will make
you extremely unpopular.

Creating a Vector {#recipe-id038}
-----------------

### Problem {-#problem-id038}

You want to create a vector.

### Solution {-#solution-id038}

Use the `c(...)` operator to construct a vector from given values.

### Discussion {-#discussion-id038}

Vectors are a central component of R, not just another data structure. A
vector can contain either numbers, strings, or logical values, but not a
mixture.

The `c(...)` operator can construct a vector from simple elements:

``` {r}
c(1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)
c(1 * pi, 2 * pi, 3 * pi, 4 * pi)
c("My", "twitter", "handle", "is", "@cmastication")
c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
```
If the arguments to `c(...)` are themselves vectors, it flattens them
and combines them into one single vector:
``` {r}
v1 <- c(1, 2, 3)
v2 <- c(4, 5, 6)
c(v1, v2)
```
Vectors cannot contain a mix of data types, such as numbers and strings.
If you create a vector from mixed elements, R will try to accommodate
you by converting one of them:
``` {r}
v1 <- c(1, 2, 3)
v3 <- c("A", "B", "C")
c(v1, v3)
```

Here, the user tried to create a vector from both numbers and strings. R
converted all the numbers to strings before creating the vector, thereby
making the data elements compatible. Note that R does this without warning or complaint. 

Technically speaking, two data elements can coexist in a vector only if
they have the same mode. The modes of `3.1415` and `"foo"` are `numeric`
and `character`, respectively:

``` {r}
mode(3.1415)
mode("foo")
```

Those modes are incompatible. To make a vector from them, R converts
`3.1415` to `character` mode so it will be compatible with `"foo"`:

``` {r}
c(3.1415, "foo")
mode(c(3.1415, "foo"))
```

> **Warning**
>
> `c` is a generic operator, which means that it works with many
> data types and not just vectors. However, it might not do exactly what
> you expect, so check its behavior before applying it to other
> data types and objects.

### See Also {-#see_also-id038}

See the introduction to Chapter \ref@(DataStructures) for more about vectors and other data structures.

Computing Basic Statistics {#recipe-id101}
--------------------------

### Problem {-#problem-id101}

You want to calculate basic statistics: mean, median, standard
deviation, variance, correlation, or covariance.

### Solution {-#solution-id101}

Use one of these functions, assuming that `x` and `y` are
vectors:

-   `mean(x)`

-   `median(x)`

-   `sd(x)`

-   `var(x)`

-   `cor(x, y)`

-   `cov(x, y)`

### Discussion {-#discussion-id101}

When you first use R you might open the documentation and begin searching for
material entitled “Procedures for Calculating Standard Deviation.” It seems that such an important topic would likely require a whole chapter.

It’s not that complicated.

Standard deviation and other basic statistics are calculated by simple
functions. Ordinarily, the function argument is a vector of numbers and
the function returns the calculated statistic:

``` {r}
x <- c(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34)
mean(x)
median(x)
sd(x)
var(x)
```

The `sd` function calculates the sample standard deviation, and `var`
calculates the sample variance.

The `cor` and `cov` functions can calculate the correlation and
covariance, respectively, between two vectors:

``` {r}
x <- c(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34)
y <- log(x + 1)
cor(x, y)
cov(x, y)
```

All these functions are picky about values that are not available (NA).
Even one NA value in the vector argument causes any of these functions
to return NA or even halt altogether with a cryptic error:

``` {r, error=TRUE}
x <- c(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, NA)
mean(x)
sd(x)
```

It’s annoying when R is that cautious, but it is appropriate.
You must think carefully about your situation. Does an NA in your data
invalidate the statistic? If yes, then R is doing the right thing. If
not, you can override this behavior by setting `na.rm=TRUE`, which tells
R to ignore the NA values:

``` {r}
x <- c(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, NA)
sd(x, na.rm = TRUE)
```

In older versions of R, `mean` and `sd` were smart about data
frames. They understood that each column of the data frame is a
different variable, so they calculated their statistic for each column
individually. This is no longer the case and, as a result, you may read confusing comments online or in older books (like the first edition of this book). In order to apply the functions to each column of a data frame we now need to use a helper function. The tidyverse family of helper functions for this sort of thing is in the `purrr` package. As with other tidyverse packages, this gets loaded when you run `library(tidyverse)`. The function we'll use to apply a function to each column of a data frame is `map_dbl`:

``` {r}
data(cars)

map_dbl(cars, mean)
map_dbl(cars, sd)
map_dbl(cars, median)
```

Notice in this example that `mean` and `sd` each return two values, one for each column defined by the data frame. (Technically, they return a two-element vector whose `names` attribute is taken from the columns of the data frame.)

The `var` function understands data frames without the help of a mapping function. It calculates the covariance between the columns of the data frame and returns the covariance matrix:

``` {r}
var(cars)
```

Likewise, if `x` is either a data frame or a matrix, then `cor(x)`
returns the correlation matrix and `cov(x)` returns the covariance
matrix:

``` {r}
cor(cars)
cov(cars)
```

Creating Sequences {#recipe-id021}
------------------

### Problem {-#problem-id021}

You want to create a sequence of numbers.

### Solution {-#solution-id021}

Use an `n:m` expression to create the simple sequence *n*, *n*+1, *n*+2, ..., *m*:

``` {r}
1:5
```

Use the `seq` function for sequences with an increment other than 1:

``` {r}
seq(from = 1, to = 5, by = 2)
```

Use the `rep` function to create a series of repeated values:

``` {r}
rep(1, times = 5)
```

### Discussion {-#discussion-id021}

The colon operator (`n:m`) creates a vector containing the sequence *n*,
*n*+1, *n*+2, ..., *m*:

``` {r}
0:9
10:19
9:0
```

R was clever with the last expression (`9:0`). Because 9 is
larger than 0, it counts backward from the starting to ending value. You can also use the colon operator directly with the pipe to pass data to another function:
```{r eval=FALSE}
10:20 %>% mean()
```
The colon operator works for sequences that grow by 1 only. The `seq`
function also builds sequences but supports an optional third argument,
which is the increment:

``` {r}
seq(from = 0, to = 20)
seq(from = 0, to = 20, by = 2)
seq(from = 0, to = 20, by = 5)
```

Alternatively, you can specify a length for the output sequence and then
R will calculate the necessary increment:

``` {r}
seq(from = 0, to = 20, length.out = 5)
seq(from = 0, to = 100, length.out = 5)
```

The increment need not be an integer. R can create sequences with
fractional increments, too:

``` {r}
seq(from = 1.0, to = 2.0, length.out = 5)
```

For the special case of a “sequence” that is simply a repeated value, you
should use the `rep` function, which repeats its first argument:

``` {r}
rep(pi, times = 5)
```

### See Also {-#see_also-id021}

See Recipe \@ref(recipe-id047), ["Creating a Sequence of Dates"](#recipe-id047), for creating a sequence of `Date` objects.

Comparing Vectors {#recipe-id020}
-----------------

### Problem {-#problem-id020}

You want to compare two vectors, or you want to compare an entire vector
against a scalar.

### Solution {-#solution-id020}

The comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`) can perform
an element-by-element comparison of two vectors. They can also compare a
vector’s element against a scalar. The result is a vector of logical
values in which each value is the result of one element-wise comparison.

### Discussion {-#discussion-id020}

R has two logical values, `TRUE` and `FALSE`. These are often called
*Boolean* values in other programming languages.

The comparison operators compare two values and return `TRUE` or
`FALSE`, depending upon the result of the comparison:

``` {r}
a <- 3
a == pi # Test for equality
a != pi # Test for inequality
a < pi
a > pi
a <= pi
a >= pi
```

You can experience the power of R by comparing entire vectors at once. R
will perform an element-by-element comparison and return a vector of
logical values, one for each comparison:

``` {r}
v <- c(3, pi, 4)
w <- c(pi, pi, pi)
v == w # Compare two 3-element vectors
v != w
v < w
v <= w
v > w
v >= w
```

You can also compare a vector against a single scalar, in which case R
will expand the scalar to the vector’s length and then perform the
element-wise comparison. The previous example can be simplified in this
way:

``` {r}
v <- c(3, pi, 4)
v == pi # Compare a 3-element vector against one number
v != pi
```

(This is an application of the Recycling Rule discussed in Recipe \@ref(recipe-id050), ["Understanding the Recycling Rule"](#recipe-id050).)

After comparing two vectors, you often want to know whether *any* of the
comparisons were true or whether *all* the comparisons were true. The
`any` and `all` functions handle those tests. They both test a logical
vector. The `any` function returns `TRUE` if any element of the vector
is `TRUE`. The `all` function returns `TRUE` if all elements of the
vector are `TRUE`:

``` {r}
v <- c(3, pi, 4)
any(v == pi) # Return TRUE if any element of v equals pi
all(v == 0) # Return TRUE if all elements of v are zero
```

Selecting Vector Elements {#recipe-id039}
-------------------------

### Problem {-#problem-id039}

You want to extract one or more elements from a vector.

### Solution {-#solution-id039}

Select the indexing technique appropriate for your problem:

-   Use square brackets to select vector elements by their position,
    such as `v[3]` for the third element of `v`.

-   Use negative indexes to exclude elements.

-   Use a vector of indexes to select multiple values.

-   Use a logical vector to select elements based on a condition.

-   Use names to access named elements.

### Discussion {-#discussion-id039}

Selecting elements from vectors is another powerful feature of R. Basic
selection is handled just as in many other programming languages—use
square brackets and a simple index:

``` {r}
fib <- c(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34)
fib
fib[1]
fib[2]
fib[3]
fib[4]
fib[5]
```

Notice that the first element has an index of 1, not 0 as in some other
programming languages.

A cool feature of vector indexing is that you can select multiple
elements at once. The index itself can be a vector, and each element of
that indexing vector selects an element from the data vector:

``` {r}
fib[1:3] # Select elements 1 through 3
fib[4:9] # Select elements 4 through 9
```

An index of 1:3 means select elements 1, 2, and 3, as just shown. The
indexing vector needn’t be a simple sequence, however. You can select
elements anywhere within the data vector—as in this example, which
selects elements 1, 2, 4, and 8:

``` {r}
fib[c(1, 2, 4, 8)]
```

R interprets negative indexes to mean *exclude* a value. An index of –1,
for instance, means exclude the first value and return all other values:

``` {r}
fib[-1] # Ignore first element
```

You can extend this method to exclude whole slices by using an indexing
vector of negative indexes:

``` {r}
fib[1:3] # As before
fib[-(1:3)] # Invert sign of index to exclude instead of select
```

Another indexing technique uses a logical vector to select elements from
the data vector. Everywhere that the logical vector is `TRUE`, an
element is selected:

``` {r}
fib < 10 # This vector is TRUE wherever fib is less than 10
fib[fib < 10] # Use that vector to select elements less than 10
fib %% 2 == 0 # This vector is TRUE wherever fib is even
fib[fib %% 2 == 0] # Use that vector to select the even elements
```

Ordinarily, the logical vector should be the same length as the data
vector so you are clearly either including or excluding each element.
(If the lengths differ, then you need to understand the Recycling Rule, discussed in Recipe \@ref(recipe-id050), ["Understanding the Recycling Rule"](#recipe-id050).) 

By combining vector comparisons, logical operators, and vector indexing,
you can perform powerful selections with very little R code.

Select all elements greater than the median:

```{r}
v <- c(3, 6, 1, 9, 11, 16, 0, 3, 1, 45, 2, 8, 9, 6, -4)
v[ v > median(v)]
```

Select all elements in the lower and upper 5%:
```{r}
v[ (v < quantile(v, 0.05)) | (v > quantile(v, 0.95)) ]
```
The previous example uses the `|` operator, which means "or" when indexing. If you wanted "and," you would use the `&` operator. 

Select all elements that exceed ±1 standard deviations from the mean:
```{r}
v[ abs(v - mean(v)) > sd(v)]
```

Select all elements that are neither `NA` nor `NULL`:
```{r}
v <- c(1, 2, 3, NA, 5)
v[!is.na(v) & !is.null(v)]
```

One final indexing feature lets you select elements by name. It assumes
that the vector has a `names` attribute, defining a name for each
element. You can define the names by assigning a vector of character strings to
the attribute:

``` {r}
years <- c(1960, 1964, 1976, 1994)
names(years) <- c("Kennedy", "Johnson", "Carter", "Clinton")
years
```

Once the names are defined, you can refer to individual elements by
name:

``` {r}
years["Carter"]
years["Clinton"]
```

This generalizes to allow indexing by vectors of names; R returns every
element named in the index:

``` {r}
years[c("Carter", "Clinton")]
```

Performing Vector Arithmetic {#recipe-id019}
----------------------------

### Problem {-#problem-id019}

You want to operate on an entire vector at once.

### Solution {-#solution-id019}

The usual arithmetic operators can perform element-wise operations on
entire vectors. Many functions operate on entire vectors, too, and
return a vector result.

### Discussion {-#discussion-id019}

Vector operations are one of R’s great strengths. All the basic
arithmetic operators can be applied to pairs of vectors. They operate in
an element-wise manner; that is, the operator is applied to
corresponding elements from both vectors:

``` {r}
v <- c(11, 12, 13, 14, 15)
w <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
v + w
v - w
v * w
v / w
w^v
```

Observe that the length of the result here is equal to the length of the
original vectors. The reason is that each element comes from a pair of
corresponding values in the input vectors.

If one operand is a vector and the other is a scalar, then the operation
is performed between every vector element and the scalar:

``` {r}
w
w + 2
w - 2
w * 2
w / 2
2^w
```

For example, you can recenter an entire vector in one expression simply
by subtracting the mean of its contents:

``` {r}
w
mean(w)
w - mean(w)
```

Likewise, you can calculate the *z*-score of a vector in one expression:
subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation:

``` {r}
w
sd(w)
(w - mean(w)) / sd(w)
```

Yet the implementation of vector-level operations goes far beyond
elementary arithmetic. It pervades the language, and many functions
operate on entire vectors. The functions `sqrt` and `log`, for example,
apply themselves to every element of a vector and return a vector of
results:

``` {r}
w <- 1:5
w
sqrt(w)
log(w)
sin(w)
```

There are two great advantages to vector operations. The first and most
obvious is convenience. Operations that require looping in other
languages are one-liners in R. The second is speed. Most vectorized
operations are implemented directly in C code, so they are substantially
faster than the equivalent R code you could write.

### See Also {-#see_also-id019}

Performing an operation between a vector and a scalar is actually a
special case of the Recycling Rule; see Recipe \@ref(recipe-id050), ["Understanding the Recycling Rule"](#recipe-id050).

Getting Operator Precedence Right {#recipe-id018}

operator precedence is causing problems.

Table: (\#tab:precedence) Operator precedence

It's not important that you know what every one of these operators does, or what they mean. The list here is intended simply to expose you to the idea that different operators have different precedence. 


### Discussion {-#discussion-id018}

Getting your operator precedence wrong in R is a common problem. It
certainly happens to us a lot. We unthinkingly expect that the expression
`0:n-1` will create a sequence of integers from 0 to *n*–1 but it does
not:

``` {r}
n <- 10
0:n - 1
```

It creates the sequence from –1 to *n*–1 because R interprets it as
`(0:n)-1`.

You might not recognize the notation `%`*any*`%` in the table. R
interprets any text between percent signs (`%`...`%`) as a binary
operator. Several such operators have predefined meanings:

`%%`

:   Modulo operator

`%/%`

:   Integer division

`%*%`

:   Matrix multiplication

`%in%`

:   Returns `TRUE` if the left operand occurs in its right operand;
    `FALSE` otherwise

`%>%`

:   Pipe that passes results from the left to a function on the right


You can also define new binary operators using the `%`...`%` notation;
see Recipe \@ref(recipe-id114), ["Defining Your Own Binary Operators"](#recipe-id114). The point here is that all such operators have
the same precedence.

Typing Less and Accomplishing More {#recipe-id022}
----------------------------------

### Problem {-#problem-id022}

You are getting tired of typing long sequences of commands and
especially tired of typing the same ones over and over.

### Solution {-#solution-id022}

Open an editor window and accumulate your reusable blocks of R commands
there. Then, execute those blocks directly from that window. Reserve the
console window for typing brief or one-off commands.

When you are done, you can save the accumulated code blocks in a script
file for later use.

### Discussion {-#discussion-id022}

The typical R beginner types an expression in the console window and sees what happens. As
he gets more comfortable, he types increasingly complicated expressions.
Then he begins typing multiline expressions. Soon, he is typing the same
multiline expressions over and over, perhaps with small variations, in
order to perform his increasingly complicated calculations.

The experienced R user does not often retype a complex expression. She may
type the same expression once or twice, but when she realizes it is
useful and reusable she will cut and paste it into an editor window. To execute the snippet thereafter, she selects the snippet in
the editor window and tells R to execute it, rather than retyping it.
This technique is especially powerful as her snippets evolve into long
blocks of code.

In RStudio, a few shortcuts in the IDE facilitate this work style.
Windows and Linux machines have slightly different keys than Mac machines:
Windows/Linux uses the _Ctrl_ and _Alt_ modifiers, whereas the Mac uses _Cmd_ and _Opt_.

To open an editor window

:   From the main menu, select File → New File, then select the type of file you want to create—in this case, an R Script. Or if you simply want an R script, you can press Shift-Ctrl-N (Windows) or Shift-Cmd-N (Mac).

To execute one line of the editor window

:   Position the cursor on the line and then press Ctrl-Enter (Windows) or Cmd-Enter (Mac) to execute it.

To execute several lines of the editor window

:   Highlight the lines using your mouse; then press Ctrl-Enter (Windows) or Cmd-Enter (Mac)  to
    execute them.

To execute the entire contents of the editor window

:   Press Ctrl-Alt-R (Windows) or Cmd-Opt-R (Mac) to execute the whole editor window. Or from the menu, click Code → Run Region → Run All.

You can find these keyboard shortcuts and dozens more within RStudio by clicking the menu Tools → Keyboard Shortcuts Help.

Reproducing lines from the console window in the editor window is simply a
matter of copy and paste. When you exit RStudio, it will ask if you want to
save the new script. You can either save it for future reuse or discard
it.


Creating a Pipeline of Function Calls {#recipe-pipe-2}
------------------

### Problem {-#problem-pipe-2}
Creating many intermediate variables in your code is tedious and overly verbose, while nesting R functions seems nearly unreadable. 

### Solution {-#solution-pipe-2}
Use the pipe operator (`%>%`) to make your expression easier to read and write. The pipe operator (`%>%`), created by Stefan Bache and found in the `magrittr` package, is used extensively in many `tidyverse` functions as well. 

Use the pipe operator to combine multiple functions together into a "pipeline" of functions without intermediate variables:

```{r pipe-head, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
data(mpg)

mpg %>%
  filter(cty > 21) %>%
  head(3) %>%
  print()
```

Using the pipe is much cleaner and easier to read than using intermediate temporary variables:

```{r pipe-temp}
temp1 <- filter(mpg, cty > 21) 
temp2 <- head(temp1, 3)
print(temp2)
```

### Discussion {-#discussion-pipe-2}

The pipe operator does not provide any new functionality to R, but it can greatly improve the readability of code. The pipe operator takes the output of the function or object on the left of the operator and passes it as the first argument of the function on the right. 

Writing this:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
x %>% head()
```
is functionally the same as writing this:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
head(x)
```
In both cases `x` is the argument to `head`. We can supply additional arguments, but `x` is always the *first* argument. These two lines are functionally identical:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x %>% head(n = 10)

head(x, n = 10)
```

This difference may seem small, but with a more complicated example, the benefits begin to accumulate. If we had a workflow where we wanted to use `filter` to limit our data to values, then `select` to keep only certain variables, followed by `ggplot` to create a simple plot, we could use intermediate variables. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

filtered_mpg <- filter(mpg, cty > 21)
selected_mpg <- select(filtered_mpg, cty, hwy)
ggplot(selected_mpg, aes(cty, hwy)) + geom_point()
```
This incremental approach is fairly readable but creates a number of intermediate data frames and requires the user to keep track of the state of many objects, which can add cognitive load. But the code does produce the desired graph.

Another alternative is to nest the functions together:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(select(filter(mpg, cty > 21), cty, hwy), aes(cty, hwy)) + geom_point()
```
While this is very concise since it's only one line, this code requires much more attention to read and understand what's going on. Code that is difficult for the user to parse mentally can introduce potential for error, and can also be harder to maintain in the future.

```{r pipeplotexample, fig.cap='Plotting with pipes example', message=FALSE}

mpg %>%
  filter(cty > 21) %>%
  select(cty, hwy) %>%
  ggplot(aes(cty, hwy)) + geom_point()
```

The preceding code starts with the `mpg` dataset and pipes it to the `filter` function, which keeps only records where the city mpg (`cty`) is greater than 21. Those results are piped into the `select` command, which keeps only the listed variables `cty` and `hwy`, and in turn those are piped into the `ggplot` command, where a point plot is produced in Figure \@ref(fig:pipeplotexample).

If you want the argument going into your target (righthand side) function to be somewhere other than the first argument, use the dot (`.`) operator. So this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
iris %>% head(3)
```
is the same as:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
iris %>% head(3, x = .)
```
However, in the second example we passed the `iris` data frame into the second named argument using the dot operator. This can be handy for functions where the input data frame goes in a position other than the first argument.

Through this book we use pipes to hold together data transformations with multiple steps. We typically format the code with a line break after each pipe and then indent the code on the following lines. This makes the code easily identifiable as parts of the same data pipeline. 

Avoiding Some Common Mistakes {#recipe-id025}
-----------------------------

### Problem {-#problem-id025}

You want to avoid some of the common mistakes made by beginning users—and also by experienced users, for that matter. 

### Discussion {-#discussion-id025}

Here are some easy ways to make trouble for yourself.

#### Forgetting the parentheses after a function invocation {-}  
You call an R function by putting parentheses after the name. For instance, this line invokes the `ls` function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ls()
```

However, if you omit the parentheses, R does not execute
    the function. Instead, it shows the function definition, which is
    almost never what you want:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
ls

# > function (name, pos = -1L, envir = as.environment(pos), all.names = FALSE,
# >     pattern, sorted = TRUE)
# > {
# >     if (!missing(name)) {
# >         pos <- tryCatch(name, error = function(e) e)
# >         if (inherits(pos, "error")) {
# >             name <- substitute(name)
# >             if (!is.character(name))
# >                 name <- deparse(name)
# > etc...
```

#### Mistyping “`<-`” as “`<` (space) `-`” {-}  
The assignment operator is `<-`, with no space between the `<` and
    the `-`:

``` {r}
x <- pi # Set x to 3.1415926...
```

If you accidentally insert a space between `<` and `-`, the meaning
changes completely:

``` {r}
x < -pi # Oops! We are comparing x instead of setting it!
```

This is now a comparison (`<`) between `x` and negative $\pi$ (`-pi`). It does not change `x`. If you are lucky, `x` is undefined and R will complain, alerting you that something is fishy:

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
rm(list = ls())
```
``` {r, error=TRUE}
x < -pi
```

If `x` is defined, R will perform the comparison and print a logical
value, `TRUE` or `FALSE`. That should alert you that something is
wrong, as an assignment does not normally print anything:

``` {r}
x <- 0 # Initialize x to zero
x < -pi # Oops!
```

#### Incorrectly continuing an expression across lines {-}  
R reads your typing until you finish a complete expression, no
    matter how many lines of input that requires. It prompts you for
    additional input using the `+` prompt until it is satisfied. This
    example splits an expression across two lines:

``` {r}
total <- 1 + 2 + 3 + # Continued on the next line
  4 + 5
print(total)
```

Problems begin when you accidentally finish the expression
prematurely, which can easily happen:

``` {r}
total <- 1 + 2 + 3 # Oops! R sees a complete expression
+4 + 5 # This is a new expression; R prints its value
print(total)
```

There are two clues that something is amiss: R prompted you with a
normal prompt (`>`), not the continuation prompt (`+`), and it
printed the value of 4 + 5.

This common mistake is a headache for the casual user. It is a
nightmare for programmers, however, because it can introduce
hard-to-find bugs into R scripts.

#### Using `=` instead of `==` {-} 
Use the double-equals operator (`==`) for comparisons. If you
    accidentally use the single-equals operator (`=`), you will
    irreversibly overwrite your variable:

``` {r}
v <- 1 # Assign 1 to v
v == 0 # Compare v against zero
v = 0 # Assign 0 to v, overwriting previous contents
print(v)
```

#### Writing 1:n+1 when you mean 1:(n+1) {-} 
You might think that `1:n+1` is the sequence of numbers 1, 2, ...,
    *n*, *n*+1. It’s not. It is the sequence 1, 2, ..., *n* with 1
    added to every element, giving 2, 3, ..., *n*, *n*+1. This happens
    because R interprets `1:n+1` as `(1:n)+1`. Use parentheses to get
    exactly what you want:

``` {r}
n <- 5
1:n + 1
1:(n + 1)
```

#### Getting bitten by the Recycling Rule {-}  
Vector arithmetic and vector comparisons work well when both vectors
    have the same length. However, the results can be baffling when the
    operands are vectors of differing lengths. Guard against this
    possibility by understanding and remembering the Recycling Rule (see Recipe \@ref(recipe-id050), ["Understanding the Recycling Rule"](#recipe-id050)).

#### Installing a package but not loading it with library or require {-} 
Installing a package is the first step toward using it, but one more
    step is required. Use `library` or `require` to load the package
    into your search path. Until you do so, R will not recognize the
    functions or datasets in the package (see Recipe \@ref(recipe-id013), ["Accessing the Functions in a Package"](#recipe-id013)):

``` {r, error=TRUE}
x <- rnorm(100)
n <- 5
truehist(x, n)
```

However, if we load the library first, then the code runs and we get the chart shown in Figure  \@ref(fig:histexample).

```{r histexample, fig.cap='Example truehist' , message=FALSE}
library(MASS) # Load the MASS package into R
truehist(x, n)
```

We typically use `library` instead of `require`. The reason is that if you create an R script that uses `library` and the desired package is not already installed, R will return an error. In contrast, `require` will simply return `FALSE` if the package is not installed. 

#### Writing aList[i] when you mean aList[[i]], or vice versa {-}  
If the variable `lst` contains a list, it can be indexed in two
    ways: `lst[[n]]` is the *n*th element of the list, whereas `lst[n]`
    is a list whose only element is the *n*th element of `lst`. That’s a
    big difference. See Recipe \@ref(recipe-id054), ["Selecting List Elements by Position"](#recipe-id054).

#### Using & instead of &&, or vice versa; same for | and || {-}  
Use `&` and `|` in logical expressions involving the logical values `TRUE` and `FALSE`. See Recipe \@ref(recipe-id039), ["Selecting Vector Elements"](#recipe-id039).

Use `&&` and `||` for the flow-of-control expressions inside `if`
and `while` statements.

Programmers accustomed to other programming languages may
reflexively use `&&` and `||` everywhere because “they are faster.”
But those operators give peculiar results when applied to vectors of
logical values, so avoid them unless you are sure that they do what you want.


#### Passing multiple arguments to a single-argument function {-}  
What do you think is the value of `mean(9,10,11)`? No, it’s not 10.
It’s 9. The `mean` function computes the mean of the first argument.
The second and third arguments are being interpreted as other,
positional arguments. To pass multiple items into a single argument, we put them in a vector with the `c` operator. `mean(c(9,10,11))` will return 10, as you might expect. 

Some functions, such as `mean`, take one argument. Other arguments,
such as `max` and `min`, take multiple arguments and apply
themselves across all arguments. Be sure you know which is which.

#### Thinking that max behaves like pmax, or that min behaves like pmin {-}  
The `max` and `min` functions have multiple arguments and return one
value: the maximum or minimum of all their arguments.

The `pmax` and `pmin` functions have multiple arguments but return a
vector with values taken element-wise from the arguments. For more info, see Recipe \@ref(recipe-id107),
["Finding Parwise Minimums or Maximums"](#recipe-id107).

#### Misusing a function that does not understand data frames {-}  
Some functions are quite clever regarding data frames. They apply
themselves to the individual columns of the data frame, computing
their result for each individual column. Sadly, not all functions are that clever.
This includes the
`mean`, `median`, `max`, and `min` functions. They will lump together every
value from every column and compute their result from the lump or possibly just return     an error. Be aware of which functions are
savvy to data frames and which are not. When in doubt, read the documentation for the function you are considering. 

#### Using single backslash (`\`) in Windows Paths {-}

If you are using R on Windows, it is common to copy and paste a filepath into your R script. Windows File Explorer will show you that your path is *C:\\temp\\my_file.csv*, but if you try to tell R to read that file, you'll get a cryptic message:

```
Error: '\m' is an unrecognized escape in character string starting "'.\temp\m"
```

This is because R sees backslashes as special characters. You can get around this by using either forward slashes (`/`) or double backslashes (`\\`). 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
read_csv(`./temp/my_file.csv`)
read_csv(`.\\temp\\my_file.csv`)
```
This is only an issue on Windows because both Mac and Linux use forward slashes as path separators. 


#### Posting a question to Stack Overflow or the mailing list before searching for the answer {-}  
Don’t waste your time. Don’t waste other people’s time. Before you
post a question to a mailing list or to Stack Overflow, do your
homework and search the archives. Odds are, someone has already
answered your question. If so, you’ll see the answer in the
discussion thread for the question. See Recipe \@ref(recipe-id268), ["Searching the Mailing Lists"](#recipe-id268).
