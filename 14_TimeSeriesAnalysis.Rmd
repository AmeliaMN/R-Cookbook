# Time Series Analysis {#TimeSeriesAnalysis}

Introduction {-}
------------

Time series analysis has become a hot topic with the rise of
quantitative finance and automated trading of securities. Many of the
facilities described in this chapter were invented by practitioners and
researchers in finance, securities trading, and portfolio management.

Before you start any time series analysis in R, a key decision is your
choice of data representation (object class). This is especially
critical in an object-oriented language such as R, because the choice
affects more than how the data is stored; it also dictates which
functions (methods) will be available for loading, processing,
analyzing, printing, and plotting your data. When many people start using
R they simply store time series data in vectors. That
seems natural. However, they quickly discover that none of the coolest
analytics for time series analysis work with simple vectors. We've found when users
switch to using an object class intended for time series data,
the analysis gets easier, opening a gateway to valuable functions and analytics.

This chapter’s first recipe recommends using the `zoo` or `xts` packages
for representing time series data. They are quite general and should
meet the needs of most users. Nearly every subsequent recipe assumes you
are using one of those two representations.

> **Note**
>
> The `xts` implementation is a superset of `zoo`, so `xts` can do
> everything that `zoo` can do. In this chapter, whenever a recipe works
> for a `zoo` object, you can safely assume (unless stated otherwise)
> that it also works for an `xts` object.

### Other Representations {-}

Other representations of time series data are available in the R universe, including:

* `fts` package
* `irts` from the `tseries` package
* `timeSeries` package
* `ts` (base distribution)
* `tsibble` package, a tidyverse style package for time series

In fact, there is a whole toolkit, called `tsbox`, just for converting between representations.

Two representations deserve special mention.

#### ts (base distribution) {-}

The base distribution of R includes a time series class called `ts`. We
don’t recommend this representation for general use because the
implementation itself is too limited and restrictive.

However, the base distribution includes some important time series analytics
that depend upon `ts`, such as the autocorrelation function (`acf`)
and the cross-correlation function (`ccf`).
To use those base functions on `xts` data, use the `to.ts` function
to "downshift" your data into the `ts` representation before calling the function.
For example, if `x` is an `xts` object, you can compute its autocorrelation
like this:

```
acf(as.ts(x))
```

#### tsibble package {-}

The `tsibble` package is a recent extension to the tidyverse,
specifically designed for working with time series data
within the tidyverse.
We find it useful for *cross-sectional* data—that is, data for which the observations are grouped by date,
and you want to perform analytics *within* dates more
than *across* dates.

### Date Versus Datetime {-}

Every observation in a time series has an associated date or time. The
object classes used in this chapter, `zoo` and `xts`, give you the
choice of using either dates or datetimes for representing the data’s
time component. You would use dates to represent daily data, of course,
and also for weekly, monthly, or even annual data; in these cases, the
date gives the day on which the observation occurred. You would use
datetimes for intraday data, where both the date and time of observation
are needed.

In describing this chapter’s recipes, we found it pretty cumbersome to keep
saying “date or datetime.” So we simplified the prose by assuming that
your data are daily and thus use whole dates. Please bear in mind, of
course, that you are free and able to use timestamps below the
resolution of a calendar date.

### See Also {-}

R has many useful functions and packages for time series analysis.
You’ll find pointers to them in the
[task view for Time Series Analysis](http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/TimeSeries.html).

Representing Time Series Data {#recipe-id076}
-----------------------------

### Problem {-#problem-id076}

You want an R data structure that can represent time series data.

### Solution {-#solution-id076}

We recommend the `zoo` and `xts` packages. They define a data structure
for time series, and they contain many useful functions for working with
time series data. Create a `zoo` object this way where `x` is a vector, matrix,
or data frame, and `dt` is a vector of corresponding dates or datetimes:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
library(zoo)
ts <- zoo(x, dt)
```

Create an `xts` object in this way:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
library(xts)
ts <- xts(x, dt)
```

Convert between representations of the time series data by using
`as.zoo` and `as.xts`:

`as.zoo(ts)`

:   Converts `ts` to a `zoo` object

`as.xts(ts)`

:   Converts `ts` to an `xts` object

### Discussion {-#discussion-id076}

R has at least eight different implementations of data structures for
representing time series. We haven’t tried them all, but we can say that `zoo` and `xts` are excellent packages for working with
time series data and better than the others that we have tried.

These representations assume you have two vectors: a vector of
observations (data) and a vector of dates or times of those
observations. The `zoo` function combines them into a `zoo` object:

``` {r}
library(zoo)
x <- c(3, 4, 1, 4, 8)
dt <- seq(as.Date("2018-01-01"), as.Date("2018-01-05"), by = "days")

ts <- zoo(x, dt)
print(ts)
```

The `xts` function is similar, returning an `xts` object:

``` {r}
library(xts)
ts <- xts(x, dt)
print(ts)
```

The data, `x`, should be numeric. The vector of dates or datetimes,
`dt`, is called the *index*. Legal indices vary between the packages:

`zoo`

:   The index can be any ordered values, such as `Date` objects,
    `POSIXct` objects, integers, or even floating-point values.

`xts`

:   The index must be a supported date or time class. This includes
    `Date`, `POSIXct`, and `chron` objects. Those should be sufficient
    for most applications, but you can also use `yearmon`, `yearqtr`,
    and `dateTime` objects. The `xts` package is more restrictive than
    `zoo` because it implements powerful operations that require a
    time-based index.

The following example creates a `zoo` object that contains the price of
IBM stock for the first five days of 2010; it uses `Date` objects for
the index:

``` {r}
prices <- c(132.45, 130.85, 130.00, 129.55, 130.85)
dates <- as.Date(c(
  "2010-01-04", "2010-01-05", "2010-01-06",
  "2010-01-07", "2010-01-08"
))
ibm.daily <- zoo(prices, dates)
print(ibm.daily)
```

In contrast, the next example captures the price of IBM stock at
one-second intervals. It represents time by the number of hours past
midnight starting at 9:30 a.m. (1 second = 0.00027778 hours, more or less):

``` {r}
prices <- c(131.18, 131.20, 131.17, 131.15, 131.17)
seconds <- c(9.5, 9.500278, 9.500556, 9.500833, 9.501111)
ibm.sec <- zoo(prices, seconds)
print(ibm.sec)
```

Those two examples used a single time series, where the data came from a
vector. Both `zoo` and `xts` can also handle multiple, parallel time
series. For this, capture the several time series in a matrix or data frame and
then create a multivariate time series by calling the `zoo` (or `xts`)
function:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
ts <- zoo(df, dt) # OR: ts <- xts(dfrm, dt)
```

The second argument is a vector of dates (or datetimes) for each
observation. There is only one vector of dates for all the time series;
in other words, all observations in each row of the matrix or data frame must have
the same date. See Recipe \@ref(recipe-id079), ["Merging Several Time Series"](#recipe-id079) if your
data has mismatched dates.

Once the data is captured inside a `zoo` or `xts` object, you can
extract the pure data via `coredata`, which returns a simple vector (or
matrix):

``` {r}
coredata(ibm.daily)
```

You can extract the date or time portion via `index`:

``` {r}
index(ibm.daily)
```

The `xts` package is very similar to `zoo`. It is optimized for
speed, so is especially well suited for processing large volumes of
data. It is also clever about converting to and from other time series
representations.

One big advantage of capturing data inside a `zoo` or `xts` object is
that special-purpose functions become available for printing, plotting,
differencing, merging, periodic sampling, applying rolling functions,
and other useful operations. There is even a function, `read.zoo`,
dedicated to reading time series data from ASCII files.

Remember that the `xts` package can do everything that the `zoo` package
can do, so everywhere that this chapter talks about `zoo` objects you
can also use `xts` objects.

If you are a serious user of time series data, we strongly recommend
studying the documentation of these packages in order to learn about the
ways they can improve your life. They are rich packages with many useful
features.

### See Also {-#see_also-id076}

See CRAN for documentation on
[`zoo`](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/zoo/) and
[`xts`](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xts/), including reference manuals, vignettes, and quick reference cards. If the
packages are already installed on your computer, view their
documentation using the `vignette` function:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
vignette("zoo")
vignette("xts")
```

The `timeSeries` package is another good implementation of a time series
object. It is part of the Rmetrics project for quantitative finance.

Plotting Time Series Data {#recipe-id089}
-------------------------

### Problem {-#problem-id089}

You want to plot one or more time series.

### Solution {-#solution-id089}

Use `plot(x)`, which works for `zoo` objects and `xts` objects
containing either single or multiple time series.

For a simple vector `v` of time series observations, you can use either
`plot(v,type = "l")` or `plot.ts(v)`.

### Discussion {-#discussion-id089}

The generic `plot` function has a version for `zoo` objects and `xts`
objects. It can plot objects that contain a single time series or
multiple time series. In the latter case, it can plot each series in a
separate plot or together in one plot.

Suppose that `ibm.infl` is a `zoo` object that contains two time series.
One shows the quoted price of IBM stock from January 2000 through December 2017, and the other is that same price adjusted for inflation. If you plot the object, R will plot the two time series together in one plot, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:ibmplot):


``` {r ibmplot, fig.cap='Example xts plot'}
load(file = "./data/ibm.rdata")
library(xts)

main <- "IBM: Historical vs. Inflation-Adjusted"
lty <- c("dotted", "solid")

# Plot the xts object
plot(ibm.infl,
  lty = lty, main = main,
  legend.loc = "left"
)
```

The `plot` function for `xts` provides a default title as simply the name of the `xts` object. As we show here, it's common to set the `main` parameter to a more meaningful title. 

The code specifies two line types (`lty`) so that the two lines are
drawn in two different styles, making them easier to distinguish. 

### See Also {-#see_also-id089}

For working with financial data, the `quantmod` package contains special
plotting functions that produce beautiful, stylized plots.

Extracting the Oldest or Newest Observations {#recipe-id077}
--------------------------------------------

### Problem {-#problem-id077}

You want to see only the oldest or newest observations of your time
series.

### Solution {-#solution-id077}

Use `head` to view the oldest observations:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
head(ts)
```

Use `tail` to view the newest observations:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
tail(ts)
```

### Discussion {-#discussion-id077}

The `head` and `tail` functions are generic, so they will work whether
your data is stored in a simple vector, a `zoo` object, or an `xts`
object.

Suppose you have a `xts` object with a multiyear history of the price of
IBM stock like the one used in the prior recipe. You can’t display the whole dataset because it would scroll
off your screen. But you can view the initial observations:

``` {r}
ibm <- ibm.infl$ibm # grab one column for illustration
head(ibm)
```

And you can view the final observations:

``` {r}
tail(ibm)
```

By default, `head` and `tail` show (respectively) the six oldest and six
newest observations. You can see more observations by providing a second
argument—for example, `tail(ibm, 20)`.

The `xts` package also includes `first` and `last` functions, which use
calendar periods instead of number of observations. We can use `first`
and `last` to select data by number of days, weeks, months, or even
years:

``` {r}
xts::first(ibm, "2 week")
```


At first glance this output might be confusing. We asked for `"2 week"` and `xts` returned six days. That might seem off until we look at a calendar of January 2000.


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=1, fig.cap='January 2000 calendar'}
knitr::include_graphics("images_v2/cal.png")
```

We can see from the calendar that the first week of January 2000 has only one day, Saturday the 1st. Then the second week runs from the 2nd to the 8th. Our data has no value for the 8th, so when we ask `first` for the first `"2 week"` it returns all the values from the first two calendar weeks. In our example dataset the first two calendar weeks contain only six values. 

Similarly, we can ask `last` to give us the last month's worth of data:
```{r}
xts::last(ibm, "month")
```

If we had been using `zoo` objects here, we would need to have converted them to `xts` objects before passing the objects to `first` or `last`, as those are `xts` functions.

### See Also {-}

See `help(first.xts)` and `help(last.xts)` for details on the `first`
and `last` functions, respectively.

> **Warning**
>
> The `tidyverse` package `dplyr` also has functions called `first` and `last`. If your workflow involves loading both `xts` and `dplyr` packages, make sure to be explicit about which function you are calling by using the `*package*::*function*` notation (for example, `xts::first`). If you want to always use a particular version, you can also use the `conflicted` package to make this explicit. 

```{r}
library(conflicted)
conflicts_prefer(xts::first, xts::last)
```


Subsetting a Time Series {#recipe-id281}
------------------------

### Problem {-#problem-id281}

You want to select one or more elements from a time series.

### Solution {-#solution-id281}

You can index a `zoo` or `xts` object by position. Use one or two
subscripts, depending upon whether the object contains one time series
or multiple time series:

`ts[i]`

:   Selects the *i*th observation from a single time series

`ts[j,i]`

:   Selects the *i*th observation of the *j*th time series of multiple
    time series

You can index the time series by date. Use the same type of
object as the index of your time series. This example assumes that the
index contains `Date` objects:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
ts[as.Date("yyyy-mm-dd")]
```

You can index it by a sequence of dates:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
dates <- seq(startdate, enddate, increment)
ts[dates]
```

The `window` function can select a range by start and end date:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
window(ts, start = startdate, end = enddate)
```

### Discussion {-#discussion-id281}

Recall our `xts` object that is a sample of inflation-adjusted IBM stock prices from the previous recipe:

``` {r}
head(ibm)
```

We can select an observation by position, just like selecting elements
from a vector (see Recipe \@ref(recipe-id039), ["Selecting Vector Elements"](#recipe-id039)):

``` {r}
ibm[2]
```

We can also select multiple observations by position:

``` {r}
ibm[2:4]
```

Sometimes it’s more useful to select by date.
Simpy use the date itself as the index.

``` {r}
ibm[as.Date("2010-01-05")]
```

Our `ibm` data is an `xts` object, so we can use date-like subsetting, too. (The `zoo` object does not offer this flexibility.)

```
ibm['2010-01-05']

ibm['20100105']
```

We can also select by a vector of `Date` objects:

``` {r}
dates <- seq(as.Date("2010-01-04"), as.Date("2010-01-08"), by = 2)
ibm[dates]
```

The `window` function is easier for selecting a range of consecutive
dates:

``` {r}
window(ibm, start = as.Date("2010-01-05"), end = as.Date("2010-01-07"))
```

We can select a year/month combination using `yyyymm` subsetting:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ibm['201001']  # Jan 2010
```

Select year ranges using `/` like so:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ibm['2009/2011'] # all of 2009 - 2011
```

Or use `/` to select ranges including months:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ibm['2009/201001'] # all of 2009 plus Jan 2010
ibm['200906/201005'] # June 2009 through May 2010
```

### See Also {-#see_also-id281}

The `xts` package provides many other clever ways to index a time
series. See the package documentation.

Merging Several Time Series {#recipe-id079}
---------------------------

### Problem {-#problem-id079}

You have two or more time series. You want to merge them into a single
time series object.

### Solution {-#solution-id079}

Use a `zoo` or `xts` object to represent the time series, then use the `merge`
function to combine them:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
merge(ts1, ts2)
```

### Discussion {-#discussion-id079}

Merging two time series is an incredible headache when the two series
have differing timestamps. Consider these two time series: the daily
price of IBM stock from 1999 through 2017, and the monthly Consumer
Price Index (CPI) for the same period:

``` {r}
load(file = "./data/ibm.rdata")
head(ibm)
head(cpi)
```

Obviously, the two time series have different timestamps because one is
daily data and the other is monthly data. Even worse, the downloaded CPI
data is timestamped for the first day of every month, even when that day
is a holiday or weekend (e.g., New Year’s Day).

Thank goodness for the `merge` function, which handles the messy details
of reconciling the different dates:

``` {r}
head(merge(ibm, cpi))
```

By default, `merge` finds the *union* of all dates: the output contains
all dates from both inputs, and missing observations are filled with `NA`
values. You can replace those `NA` values with the most recent observation
by using the `na.locf` function from the `zoo` package:

``` {r}
head(na.locf(merge(ibm, cpi)))
```

(Here `locf` stands for “last observation carried forward.”) Observe
that the `NA`s were replaced. However, `na.locf` left an NA in the first
observation (1999-01-01) because there was no IBM stock price on that
day.

You can get the *intersection* of all dates by setting `all = FALSE`:

``` {r}
head(merge(ibm, cpi, all = FALSE))
```

Now the output is limited to observations that are *common* to both
files.

Notice, however, that the intersection begins on February 1, not January 1.
The reason is that January 1 is a holiday, so there is no IBM stock price for that date and hence no
intersection with the CPI data. To fix this, see Recipe \@ref(recipe-id239), ["Filling or Padding a Time Series"](#recipe-id239).

Filling or Padding a Time Series {#recipe-id239}
--------------------------------

### Problem {-#problem-id239}

Your time series data is missing observations. You want to fill or pad
the data with the missing dates/times.

### Solution {-#solution-id239}

Create a zero-width (dataless) `zoo` or `xts` object with the missing
dates/times. Then merge your data with the zero-width object, taking the
union of all dates:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
empty <- zoo(, dates) # 'dates' is vector of the missing dates
merge(ts, empty, all = TRUE)
```

### Discussion {-#discussion-id239}

The `zoo` package includes a handy feature in the constructor for `zoo`
objects: you can omit the data and build a zero-width object. The object
contains no data, just dates. We can use these “Frankenstein” objects to
perform such operations as filling and padding on other time series
objects.

Suppose you download monthly CPI data used in the last recipe. The data is
timestamped with the first day of each month:

``` {r}
head(cpi)
```

As far as R knows, we have no observations for the other days of the
months. However, we know that each CPI value applies to the subsequent
days through month-end. So first we build a zero-width object with every
day of the decade, but no data:

``` {r}
dates <- seq(from = min(index(cpi)), to = max(index(cpi)), by = 1)
empty <- zoo(, dates)
```
We use the `min(index(cpi))` and `max(index(cpi))` to get the minimum and maximum index value from our `cpi`data. So our resulting `empty` object is just an index of daily dates with the same range as our `cpi` data. 

Then we take the union the CPI data and the zero-width object, yielding
a dataset filled with `NA` values:

``` {r}
filled.cpi <- merge(cpi, empty, all = TRUE)
head(filled.cpi)
```

The resulting time series contains every calendar day, with `NA`s where
there was no observation. That might be what you need. However, a more
common requirement is to replace each `NA` with the most recent
observation as of that date. The `na.locf` function from the `zoo`
package does exactly that:

``` {r}
filled.cpi <- na.locf(merge(cpi, empty, all = TRUE))
head(filled.cpi)
```

January’s value of `1` is carried forward until February 1, at which
time it is replaced by the February value. Now every day has the
latest CPI value as of that date. Note that in this dataset, the CPI is based on January 1, 1999 = 100% and all CPI values are relative to the value on that date.  

```{r}
tail(filled.cpi)
```

We can use this recipe to fix the problem mentioned in Recipe \@ref(recipe-id079), ["Merging Several Time Series"](#recipe-id079). There, the daily price of
IBM stock and the monthly CPI data had no intersection on certain days.
We can fix that using several different methods. One way is to pad the
IBM data to include the CPI dates and then take the intersection (recall
that `index(cpi)` returns all the dates in the CPI time series):

``` {r}
filled.ibm <- na.locf(merge(ibm, zoo(, index(cpi))))
head(merge(filled.ibm, cpi, all = FALSE))
```

That gives monthly observations. Another way is to fill out the CPI data
(as described previously) and then take the intersection with the IBM
data. That gives daily observations, as follows:

``` {r}
filled_data <- merge(ibm, filled.cpi, all = FALSE)
head(filled_data)
```

Another common method for filling missing values uses the _cubic spline_ technique,
which interpolates smooth intermediate values from the known data.
We can use the `zoo` function `na.spline` to fill our missing values using a cubic spline. 

```{r}
combined_data <- merge(ibm, cpi, all = TRUE)
head(combined_data)

combined_spline <- na.spline(combined_data)
head(combined_spline)
```

Notice that both the missing values for `cpi` and `ibm` were filled. However, the value filled in for January 1, 1999 for the `ibm` column seems out of line with the January 4th observation. This illustrates one of the challenges with cubic splines: they can become quite unstable if the value that is being interpolated is at the very beginning or the very end of a series. To get around this instability, we could get some data points from before January 1st, 1999, then interpolate using `na.spline`, or we could simply choose a different interpolation method. 

Lagging a Time Series {#recipe-id280}
---------------------

### Problem {-#problem-id280}

You want to shift a time series in time, either forward or backward.

### Solution {-#solution-id280}

Use the `lag` function. The second argument, `k`, is the number of periods
to shift the data:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
stats::lag(ts, k)
```

Use positive `k` to shift the data forward in time (tomorrow’s data
becomes today’s data). Use a negative `k` to shift the data backward in
time (yesterday’s data becomes today’s data).

### Discussion {-#discussion-id280}

Recall the `zoo` object containing five days of IBM stock prices from Recipe \@ref(recipe-id076), ["Representing Time Series Data"](#recipe-id076):

``` {r}
ibm.daily
```

To shift the data forward one day, we use `k = +1`:

``` {r}
stats::lag(ibm.daily, k = +1, na.pad = TRUE)
```

We also set `na.pad = TRUE` to fill the trailing dates with `NA`. Otherwise,
they would simply be dropped, resulting in a shortened time series.

To shift the data backward one day, we use `k = -1`. Again we use
`na.pad = TRUE` to pad the beginning with `NA`s:

``` {r}
stats::lag(ibm.daily, k = -1, na.pad = TRUE)
```

If the sign convention for `k` seems odd to you, you are not alone.

> **Warning**
>
> The function is called `lag`, but a positive `k` actually generates
> *leading* data, not lagging data. Use a negative `k` to get *lagging*
> data. Yes, this is bizarre. Perhaps the function should have been
> called `lead`.

The other thing to be careful with when using `lag` is that the `dplyr` package contains a function named `lag` as well. The arguments for `dplyr::lag` are not exactly the same as the Base R `lag` function. In particular, `dplyr` uses `n` instead of `k`:

```{r}
dplyr::lag(ibm.daily, n = 1)
```
> **Warning**
>
> If you want to load `dplyr`, you should use the namespace to be explicit about which `lag` function you are using. The Base R function is `stats::lag`, while the dplyr function is, naturally, `dplyr::lag`. You can use the `conflicted` package to make it explicit which version you want to use,

```{r}
library(conflicted)
conflicts_prefer(stats::lag)
```


Computing Successive Differences {#recipe-id141}
--------------------------------

### Problem {-#problem-id141}

Given a time series, *x*, you want to compute the difference between
successive observations: (*x*~2~ – *x*~1~), (*x*~3~ – *x*~2~), (*x*~4~ –
*x*~3~), ....

### Solution {-#solution-id141}

Use the `diff` function:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
diff(x)
```

### Discussion {-#discussion-id141}

The `diff` function is generic, so it works on simple vectors, `xts` objects, and
`zoo` objects. The beauty of differencing a `zoo` or `xts` object is that the
result is the same type object you started with *and* the differences have the correct
dates. Here we compute the differences for successive prices of IBM
stock:

``` {r}
ibm.daily
diff(ibm.daily)
```

The difference labeled 2010-01-05 is the change from the previous day
(2010-01-04), which is usually what you want. The differenced series is
shorter than the original series by one element because R can’t compute
the change as of 2010-01-04, of course.

By default, `diff` computes successive differences. You can compute
differences that are more widely spaced by using its `lag` parameter.
Suppose you have monthly CPI data and want to compute the change from
the previous 12 months, giving the year-over-year change. Specify a `lag`
of `12`:

``` {r}
head(cpi, 24)
head(diff(cpi, lag = 12), 24) # Compute year-over-year change
```

Performing Calculations on Time Series {#recipe-id080}
--------------------------------------

### Problem {-#problem-id080}

You want to use arithmetic and common functions on time series data.

### Solution {-#solution-id080}

No problem. R is pretty clever about operations on `zoo` and `xts` objects. You
can use arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, etc.) as well as
common functions (`sqrt`, `log`, etc.) and usually get what you
expect.

### Discussion {-#discussion-id080}

When you perform arithmetic on `zoo` or `xts` objects, R aligns the objects
according to date so that the results make sense. Suppose we want to
compute the percentage change in IBM stock. We need to divide the daily
change by the price, but those two time series are not naturally
aligned—they have different start times and different lengths. Here's an illustration with a `zoo` object:

``` {r}
ibm.daily
diff(ibm.daily)
```

Fortunately, when we divide one series by the other, R aligns the series
for us and returns a `zoo` object:

``` {r}
diff(ibm.daily) / ibm.daily
```

We can scale the result by 100 to compute the percentage change, and the
result is another `zoo` object:

``` {r}
100 * (diff(ibm.daily) / ibm.daily)
```

Functions work just as well. If we compute the logarithm or square root
of a `zoo` object, the result is a `zoo` object with the timestamps
preserved:

``` {r}
log(ibm.daily)
```

In investment management, computing the difference of logarithms of
prices is quite common. That’s a piece of cake in R:

``` {r}
diff(log(ibm.daily))
```

### See Also {-#see_also-id080}

See Recipe \@ref(recipe-id141), ["Computing Successive Differences"](#recipe-id141), for the special
case of computing the difference between successive values.

Computing a Moving Average {#recipe-id279}
--------------------------

### Problem {-#problem-id279}

You want to compute the moving average of a time series.

### Solution {-#solution-id279}

Use the `rollmean` function of the `zoo` package to calculate the
*k*-period moving average:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
library(zoo)
ma <- rollmean(ts, k)
```

Here `ts` is the time series data, captured in a `zoo` object, and `k` is
the number of periods.

For most financial applications, you want `rollmean` to calculate the
mean using only historical data; that is, for each day, use only the
data available that day. To do that, specify `align = right`. Otherwise,
`rollmean` will “cheat” and use future data that was actually
unavailable at the time:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
ma <- rollmean(ts, k, align = "right")
```

### Discussion {-#discussion-id279}

Traders are fond of moving averages for smoothing out fluctuations in
prices. The formal name is the *rolling mean*. You could calculate the
rolling mean as described in Recipe \@ref(recipe-id081), ["Applying a Rolling Function"](#recipe-id081), by combining the
`rollapply` function and the `mean` function, but `rollmean` is much
faster.

Beside speed, the beauty of `rollmean` is that it returns the same type of time series object it's called on (i.e., `xts` or `zoo`). For each element in the object, its date is the “as of” date for
a calculated mean. Because the result is a time series object, you can easily merge the
original data and the moving average and then plot them together as in Figure \@ref(fig:ibmroll):

```{r ibmroll, fig.cap='Rolling average plot'}
ibm_year <- ibm["2016"]
ma_ibm <- rollmean(ibm_year, 7, align = "right")
ma_ibm <- merge(ma_ibm, ibm_year)
plot(ma_ibm)
```

The output is normally missing a few initial data points, since
`rollmean` needs a full `k` observations to compute the mean.
Consequently, the output is shorter than the input. If that’s a problem,
specify `na.pad = TRUE`; then `rollmean` will pad the initial output with
`NA` values.

### See Also {-#see_also-id279}

See Recipe \@ref(recipe-id081), ["Applying a Rolling Function"](#recipe-id081), for more about the
`align` parameter.

The moving average described here is a simple moving average. The
`quantmod`, `TTR`, and `fTrading` packages contain functions for
computing and plotting many kinds of moving averages, including simple
ones.

Applying a Function by Calendar Period {#recipe-id282}
--------------------------------------

### Problem {-#problem-id282}

Given a time series, you want to group the contents by a calendar period
(e.g., week, month, or year) and then apply a function to each group.

### Solution {-#solution-id282}

The `xts` package includes functions for processing a time series by
day, week, month, quarter, or year:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
apply.daily(ts, f)
apply.weekly(ts, f)
apply.monthly(ts, f)
apply.quarterly(ts, f)
apply.yearly(ts, f)
```

Here `ts` is an `xts` time series, and `f` is the function to apply to each
day, week, month, quarter, or year.

If your time series is a `zoo` object, convert to an `xts` object first
so you can access these functions; for example:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
apply.monthly(as.xts(ts), f)
```

### Discussion {-#discussion-id282}

It is common to process time series data according to calendar period.
But figuring calendar periods is tedious at best and bizarre at worst.
Let these functions do the heavy lifting.

Suppose we have a five-year history of IBM stock prices stored in an
`xts` object:

``` {r}
ibm_5 <- ibm["2012/2017"]
head(ibm_5)
```

We can calculate the average price by month if we use `apply.monthly`
and `mean` together:

``` {r}
ibm_mm <- apply.monthly(ibm_5, mean)
head(ibm_mm)
```

Notice that the IBM data is in an `xts` object from the start. Had the data been in a `zoo` object, we would have needed to convert it to `xts` using `as.xts`.

A more interesting application is calculating volatility by calendar
month, where volatility is measured as the standard deviation of daily
log-returns. Daily log-returns are calculated this way:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
diff(log(ibm_5))
```

We calculate their standard deviation, month by month, like this:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
apply.monthly(as.xts(diff(log(ibm_5))), sd)
```

We can scale the daily number to estimate annualized volatility, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:volplot):

``` {r volplot, fig.cap='IBM volatility plot'}
ibm_vol <- sqrt(251) * apply.monthly(as.xts(diff(log(ibm_5))), sd)
plot(ibm_vol,
  main = "IBM: Monthly Volatility"
)
```

Applying a Rolling Function {#recipe-id081}
---------------------------

### Problem {-#problem-id081}

You want to apply a function to a time series in a rolling manner:
calculate the function at a data point using some window of time around that point, move to the next data point, calculate the function around that point, move to the next data point, and
so forth.

### Solution {-#solution-id081}

Use the `rollapply` function in the `zoo` package. The `width` parameter
defines how many data points from the time series (`ts`) should be
processed by the function (`f`) at each point:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
library(zoo)
rollapply(ts, width, f)
```

For many applications, you will likely set `align = "right"` to avoid
computing `f` with historical data that was unavailable at the time:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
rollapply(ts, width, f, align = "right")
```

### Discussion {-#discussion-id081}

The `rollapply` function extracts a “window” of data from your time
series, calls your function with that data, saves the result, and moves
to the next window—and repeats this pattern for the entire input. As an
illustration, consider calling `rollapply` with `width = 21`:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
rollapply(ts, 21, f)
```

`rollapply` will repeatedly call the function, `f`, with a sliding
window of data, like this:

1.  `f(ts[1:21])`

2.  `f(ts[2:22])`

3.  `f(ts[3:23])`

4.  ... `etc.` ...

Observe that the function should expect one argument, which is a vector
of values. `rollapply` will save the returned values before packaging
them into a `zoo` object along with a timestamp for every value. The
choice of timestamp depends on the `align` parameter given to
`rollapply`:

`align="right"`

:   The timestamp is taken from the rightmost value.

`align="left"`

:   The timestamp is taken from the leftmost value.

`align="center" (default)`

:   The timestamp is taken from the middle value.

By default, `rollapply` will recalculate the function at successive data
points. You may instead want to calculate the function at every *n*th
data point. Use the `by = n` parameter to have `rollapply` move ahead *n*
points after each function call. When we calculate the rolling standard
deviation of a time series, for example, we usually want each window of
data to be separate, not overlapping, so we set the `by` value equal
to the window size:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
ibm_sds <- rollapply(ibm_5, width = 30, FUN = sd, by = 30, align = "right")
ibm_sds <- na.omit(ibm_sds)
head(ibm_sds)
```

The `rollapply` function will, by default, return an object with as many observations as your input data with the missing values filled with `NA`. In the preceding example we use `na.omit` to drop the `NA` values so that our resulting object has records only for the dates for which we have values. 

Plotting the Autocorrelation Function {#recipe-id082}
-------------------------------------

### Problem {-#problem-id082}

You want to plot the autocorrelation function (ACF) of your time series.

### Solution {-#solution-id082}

Use the `acf` function:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
acf(ts)
```

### Discussion {-#discussion-id082}

The autocorrelation function is an important tool for revealing the
interrelationships within a time series. It is a collection of
correlations, $\rho_k$ for *k* = 1, 2, 3, ..., where $\rho_k$ is the
correlation between all pairs of data points that are exactly *k* steps
apart.

Visualizing the autocorrelations is much more useful than listing them,
so the `acf` function plots them for each value of *k*.
The following example shows the
autocorrelation functions for two time series, one with autocorrelations
and one without. The dashed line delimits the significant and
insignificant correlations: values above the line are significant.
(The height of the dashed line in Figures \@ref(fig:autocorr1) and \@ref(fig:autocorr2) is determined by the amount of data.)

```{r autocorr1, fig.cap='Autocorrelations at each lag: ts1'}
load(file = "./data/ts_acf.rdata")

acf(ts1, main = "Significant Autocorrelations")
```

```{r autocorr2, fig.cap='Autocorrelations at each lag: ts2'}
acf(ts2, main = "Insignificant Autocorrelations")
```

The presence of autocorrelations is one indication that an
autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model could model the
time series. From the ACF, you can count the number of significant
autocorrelations, which is a useful estimate of the number of moving
average (MA) coefficients in the model. Figure \@ref(fig:autocorr1) shows seven
significant autocorrelations, for example, so we estimate that its ARIMA
model will require seven MA coefficients (MA(7)). That estimate is just
a starting point, however, and must be verified by fitting and
diagnosing the model.

Testing a Time Series for Autocorrelation {#recipe-id104}
-----------------------------------------

### Problem {-#problem-id104}

You want to test your time series for the presence of autocorrelations.

### Solution {-#solution-id104}

Use the `Box.test` function, which implements the Box–Pierce test for
autocorrelation:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
Box.test(ts)
```

The output includes a *p*-value. Conventionally, a *p*-value of less
than 0.05 indicates that the data contains significant autocorrelations,
whereas a *p*-value exceeding 0.05 provides no such evidence.

### Discussion {-#discussion-id104}

Graphing the autocorrelation function is useful for digging into your
data. Sometimes, however, we just need to know whether or not the data
is autocorrelated. A statistical test such as the Box–Pierce test can
provide an answer.

We can apply the Box–Pierce test to the data whose autocorrelation
function we plotted in Recipe \@ref(recipe-id082), ["Plotting the Autocorrelation Function"](#recipe-id082). The test shows
*p*-values for the two time series that are nearly 0 and 0.79,
respectively:

```{r}
Box.test(ts1)

Box.test(ts2)
```

The *p*-value near 0 indicates that the first time series has
significant autocorrelations. (We don’t know which autocorrelations are
significant; we just know they exist.) The *p*-value of 0.8 indicates
that the test did not detect autocorrelations in the second time series.

The `Box.test` function can also perform the Ljung–Box test, which is
better for small samples. That test calculates a *p*-value whose
interpretation is the same as that for the Box–Pierce *p*-value:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Box.test(ts, type = "Ljung-Box")
```

### See Also {-#see_also-id104}

See Recipe \@ref(recipe-id082), ["Plotting the Autocorrelation Function"](#recipe-id082), to plot the
autocorrelation function, a visual check of the autocorrelation.

Plotting the Partial Autocorrelation Function {#recipe-id083}
---------------------------------------------

### Problem {-#problem-id083}

You want to plot the partial autocorrelation function (PACF) for your
time series.

### Solution {-#solution-id083}

Use the `pacf` function:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
pacf(ts)
```

### Discussion {-#discussion-id083}

The partial autocorrelation function is another tool for revealing the
interrelationships in a time series. However, its interpretation is much
less intuitive than that of the autocorrelation function. We’ll leave the
mathematical definition of partial correlation to a textbook on
statistics. Here, we’ll just say that the partial correlation between two
random variables, *X* and *Y*, is the correlation that remains after
accounting for the correlation shown by *X* and *Y*, with all other
variables. In the case of time series, the partial autocorrelation at
lag *k* is the correlation between all data points that are exactly *k*
steps apart—after accounting for their correlation with the data between
those *k* steps.

The practical value of a PACF is that it helps you to identify the
number of autoregression (AR) coefficients in an ARIMA model. The following example shows
the PACF for the two time series used in Recipe \@ref(recipe-id082), ["Plotting the Autocorrelation Function"](#recipe-id082).
One of these series has partial autocorrelations and one
does not. Lag values whose lines cross above the dotted line are
statistically significant. In the first time series (Figure \@ref(fig:partautocorr1)) there are two such values, at *k* = 1 and *k*
= 2, so our initial ARIMA model will have two AR coefficients (AR(2)).
As with autocorrelation, however, that is just an initial estimate and
must verified by fitting and diagnosing the model. The second time series (Figure \@ref(fig:partautocorr2)) shows no such autocorrelation pattern. 

```{r partautocorr1, fig.cap='Autocorrelations at each lag: ts1'}
pacf(ts1, main = "Significant Partial Autocorrelations")
```

```{r partautocorr2, fig.cap='Autocorrelations at each lag: ts2'}
pacf(ts2, main = "Insignificant Partial Autocorrelations")
```

Finding Lagged Correlations Between Two Time Series {#recipe-id084}
---------------------------------------------------

### Problem {-#problem-id084}

You have two time series, and you are wondering if there is a lagged
correlation between them.

### Solution {-#solution-id084}

Use the `Ccf` function from the package `forecast` to plot the cross-correlation function, which
will reveal lagged correlations:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
library(forecast)
Ccf(ts1, ts2)
```

### Discussion {-#discussion-id084}

The cross-correlation function helps you discover lagged correlations
between two time series. A lagged correlation occurs when today’s value
in one time series is correlated with a future or past value in the
other time series.

Consider the relationship between commodity prices and bond prices. Some
analysts believe those prices are connected because changes in commodity
prices are a barometer of inflation, one of the key factors in bond
pricing. Can we discover a correlation between them?

Figure \@ref(fig:bondcmd) shows a
cross-correlation function generated from daily changes in bond prices
and a commodity price index:[^index]

``` {r bondcmd, fig.cap='Cross-correlation function'}
library(forecast)
load(file = "./data/bnd_cmty.Rdata")
b <- coredata(bonds)[, 1]
c <- coredata(cmdtys)[, 1]

Ccf(b, c, main = "Bonds vs. Commodities")
```
Note that since the objects we start with, `bonds` and `cmdtys`, are `xts` objects, we extract from each the vector of data using `coredata()[1]`. This is because the `Ccf` function expects inputs to be simple vectors. 

Every vertical line shows the correlation between the two time series at
some lag, as indicated along the x-axis. If a correlation extends above
or below the dotted lines, it is statistically significant.

Notice that the correlation at lag 0 is –0.24, which is the simple
correlation between the variables:

``` {r}
cor(b, c)
```

Much more interesting are the correlations at lags 1, 5, and 8, which are
statistically significant. Evidently there is some “ripple effect” in
the day-to-day prices of bonds and commodities because changes today are
correlated with changes tomorrow. Discovering this sort of relationship
is useful to short-term forecasters such as market analysts and bond
traders.

Detrending a Time Series {#recipe-id088}
------------------------

### Problem {-#problem-id088}

Your time series data contains a trend that you want to remove.

### Solution {-#solution-id088}

Use linear regression to identify the trend component, and then subtract the
trend component from the original time series. These two lines show how
to detrend the `zoo` object `ts` and put the result in `detr`:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
m <- lm(coredata(ts) ~ index(ts))
detr <- zoo(resid(m), index(ts))
```

### Discussion {-#discussion-id088}

Some time series data contains trends, which means that it gradually
slopes upward or downward over time. Suppose your time series object (a `zoo` object in this case), `yield`, contains a trend as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:cornyields):

```{r cornyields, fig.cap='Time series with trend', echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
load(file = "./data/yield.Rdata")
autoplot(yield, geom = "point") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "IL Corn Yield (bu/ac)")
```

We can remove the trend component in two steps. First, identify the
overall trend by using the linear model function, `lm`. The model should
use the time series index for the *x* variable and the time series data
for the *y* variable.

``` {r}
m <- lm(coredata(yield) ~ index(yield))
```

Second, remove the linear trend from the original data by subtracting
the straight line found by `lm`. This is easy because we have access to
the linear model’s residuals, which are defined by the difference
between the original data and the fitted line:

$r_i = y_i - \beta_1 x_i - \beta_0$

where $r_i$ is the *i*th residual, and where $\beta_1$ and $\beta_0$ are the
model’s slope and intercept, respectively. We can extract the residuals
from the linear model by using the `resid` function and then embed the
residuals inside a `zoo` object:

``` {r}
detr <- zoo(resid(m), index(yield))
```

Notice that we use the same time index as the original data. When we
plot `detr` it is clearly trendless, as evident in Figure \@ref(fig:detrplot).

```{r detrplot, fig.cap='Residual plot'}
autoplot(detr)
```

This data is the state average corn yield for Illinois in bushels per acre (bu/ac). So `detr` is the difference between actual yield and the trend. Sometimes when detrending you may want to determine the percent deviation from the trend. In that case we can divide by the initial measure:

```{r detrended, fig.cap='Detrended plots', fig.height=7}
library(patchwork)
# y <- autoplot(yield) +
#   labs(x='Year', y='Yield (bu/ac)', title='IL Corn Yield')
d <- autoplot(detr, geom = "point") +
  labs(
    x = "Year", y = "Yield Dev (bu/ac)",
    title = "IL Corn Yield Deviation from Trend (bu/ac)"
  )
dp <- autoplot(detr / yield, geom = "point") +
  labs(
    x = "Year", y = "Yield Dev (%)",
    title = "IL Corn Yield Deviation from Trend (%)"
  )

d / dp
```
The top plot in Figure \@ref(fig:detrended) shows the yield deviation from the trend in bu/ac (the original units), while the lower plot shows the percent deviation from the trend. 


Fitting an ARIMA Model {#recipe-id085}
----------------------

### Problem {-#problem-id085}

You want to fit an ARIMA model to your time series data.

### Solution {-#solution-id085}

The `auto.arima` function in the `forecast` package can select the
correct model order and fit the model to your data:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
library(forecast)
auto.arima(x)
```

If you already know the model order, (*p*, *d*, *q*), then the `arima`
function can fit the model directly:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
arima(x, order = c(p, d, q))
```

### Discussion {-#discussion-id085}

Creating an ARIMA model involves three steps:

1.  Identify the model order.

2.  Fit the model to the data, giving the coefficients.

3.  Apply diagnostic measures to validate the model.

The model order is usually denoted by three integers, (*p*, *d*, *q*),
where *p* is the number of autoregressive coefficients, *d* is the
degree of differencing, and *q* is the number of moving average
coefficients.

When most of us build an ARIMA model, we are usually clueless about the appropriate
order. Rather than tediously searching for the best combination of *p*,
*d*, and *q*, we typically use `auto.arima`, which does the searching for us:

``` {r, message=FALSE}
library(forecast)
library(fpp2) # for example data

auto.arima(ausbeer)
```

In this case, `auto.arima` decided the best order was (1, 1, 2), which
means that it differenced the data once (*d* = 1) before selecting a
model with AR coefficients (*p* = 1) and two MA coefficients (*q* =
2). In addition, the `auto.arima` function determined that our data has seasonality and included the seasonal terms *P* = 0, *D* = 1, *Q* = 1 and a period of *m* = 4. The seasonality terms are similar to the nonseasonal ARIMA terms, but relate to the seasonality component of the model. The *m* term tells us the periodicity of the seasonality, which in this case is quarterly. We can see this easier if we plot the `ausbeer` data as in Figure \@ref(fig:ausbeer):

```{r ausbeer, fig.cap='Australian beer consumption'}
autoplot(ausbeer)
```

By default, `auto.arima` limits *p* and *q* to the range 0 ≤ *p* ≤ 5 and
0 ≤ *q* ≤ 5. If you are confident that your model needs fewer than five
coefficients, use the `max.p` and `max.q` parameters to limit the search
further; this makes it faster. Likewise, if you believe that your model
needs more coefficients, use `max.p` and `max.q` to expand the search
limits.

If you want to turn off the seasonality component of `auto.arima`, you can set `seasonal = FALSE`:

``` {r}
auto.arima(ausbeer, seasonal = FALSE)
```
But notice that since the model fits a nonseasonal model, the coefficients are different than in the seasonal model. 

If you already know the order of your ARIMA model, the `arima` function
can quickly fit the model to your data:

``` {r}
arima(ausbeer, order = c(3, 2, 2))
```

The output looks identical to `auto.arima` with the `seasonal` parameter set to `FALSE`. What you can’t see here is that `arima` executes much more quickly.

The output from `auto.arima` and `arima` includes the fitted
coefficients and the standard error (`s.e.`) for each coefficient:

``` 
Coefficients:
          ar1      ar2      ar3      ma1     ma2
      -0.9569  -0.9872  -0.9247  -1.0425  0.1416
s.e.   0.0257   0.0184   0.0242   0.0619  0.0623
```

You can find the coefficients’ confidence intervals by capturing the
ARIMA model in an object and then using the `confint` function:

``` {r}
m <- arima(x = ausbeer, order = c(3, 2, 2))
confint(m)
```

This output illustrates a major headache of ARIMA modeling: not all the
coefficients are necessarily significant. If one of the intervals contains
zero, the true coefficient might be zero itself, in which case the term is unnecessary.

If you discover that your model contains insignificant coefficients, use Recipe \@ref(recipe-id237), ["Removing Insignificant ARIMA Coefficients"](#recipe-id237), to remove
them.

The `auto.arima` and `arima` functions contain useful features for
fitting the best model. For example, you can force them to include or
exclude a trend component. See the help pages for details.

A final caveat: the danger of `auto.arima` is that it makes ARIMA
modeling look simple. ARIMA modeling is *not* simple. It is more art
than science, and the automatically generated model is just a starting
point. We urge you to review a good book about ARIMA modeling
before settling on a final model.

Removing Insignificant ARIMA Coefficients {#recipe-id237}
---------------------------------------------------------

### Problem {-#problem-id237}

One or more of the coefficients in your ARIMA model are statistically
insignificant. You want to remove them.

### Solution {-#solution-id237}

The `arima` function includes the parameter `fixed`, which is a vector.
The vector should contain one element for every coefficient in the
model, including a term for the drift (if any). Each element is either
`NA` or `0`. Use `NA` for the coefficients to be kept and use `0` for the
coefficients to be removed. This example shows an ARIMA(2, 1, 2) model
with the first AR coefficient and the first MA coefficient forced to be
`0`:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
arima(x, order = c(2, 1, 2), fixed = c(0, NA, 0, NA))
```

### Discussion {-#discussion-id237}

The `fpp2` package contains a dataset called `euretail`, which is a quarterly retail index for the Euro area. Let's run `auto.arima` on the data and look at the 98% confidence intervals:

```{r}
m <- auto.arima(euretail)
m
confint(m, level = .98)
```
In this example, we can see that the 98% confidence interval for the `ma1` parameter contains 0 and we can reasonably conclude that this parameter is insignificant at this level of confidence. We can set this parameter to `0` using the `fixed` parameter:

``` {r}
m <- arima(euretail, order = c(0, 1, 3), seasonal = c(0, 1, 1), fixed = c(0, NA, NA, NA))
m
```

Observe that the `ma1` coefficient is now `0`. The
remaining coefficients (`ma2`, `ma3`, `sma1`) are still significant, as shown
by their confidence intervals, so we have a reasonable model:

``` {r}
confint(m, level = .98)
```

Running Diagnostics on an ARIMA Model {#recipe-id238}
-------------------------------------

### Problem {-#problem-id238}

You have built an ARIMA model using the `forecast` package, and you want to run diagnostic tests to
validate the model.

### Solution {-#solution-id238}

Use the `checkresiduals` function. This example fits the ARIMA model using `auto.arima`, puts the results in `m`, and then runs diagnostics on the model:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
m <- auto.arima(x)
checkresiduals(m)
```

### Discussion {-#discussion-id238}

The result of `checkresiduals` is a set of three graphs, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:diag1). A good model should
produce results like these:

```{r diag1, fig.cap='Residuals plots: Good model', echo=FALSE }
m <- arima(euretail, order = c(1, 1, 2), seasonal = c(0, 1, 1), fixed = c(NA, NA, 0, NA))
checkresiduals(m)
```

Here’s what’s good about the graphs:

-   The standardized residuals don’t show clusters of volatility.

-   The autocorrelation function (ACF) shows no significant
    autocorrelation between the residuals.

-   The residuals look bell-shaped, suggesting they are reasonably symmetrical. 

-   The *p*-value in the Ljung–Box test is large, indicating that the residuals are patternless—meaning all the information has been extracted by the model and only noise is left behind. 

For contrast, Figure \@ref(fig:diag2) shows diagnostic charts with problems:

```{r diag2, fig.cap='Residuals plots: Problem model', echo=FALSE }
m <- arima(euretail, order = c(1, 1, 1), seasonal = c(0, 0, 1))
checkresiduals(m)
```

-   The ACF shows significant autocorrelations between residuals.

-   The *p*-values for the Ljung–Box statistics are small, indicating
    there is some pattern in the residuals. There is still information
    to be extracted from the data.

-   The residuals appear asymmetrical. 

These are basic diagnostics, but they are a good start. Find a good book
on ARIMA modeling and perform the recommended diagnostic tests before
concluding that your model is sound. Additional checks of the residuals
could include:

* Tests for normality
* Quantile–quantile (Q–Q) plot
* Scatter plot against the fitted values

Making Forecasts from an ARIMA Model {#recipe-id086}
------------------------------------

### Problem {-#problem-id086}

You have an ARIMA model for your time series that you built with the `forecast` package. You want to forecast the
next few observations in the series.

### Solution {-#solution-id086}

Save the model in an object, and then apply the `forecast` function to the
object. This example saves the model from Recipe \@ref(recipe-id237), ["Removing Insignificant ARIMA Coefficients"](#recipe-id237), and predicts
the next eight observations:

``` {r}
m <- arima(euretail, order = c(0, 1, 3), seasonal = c(0, 1, 1), fixed = c(0, NA, NA, NA))
forecast(m)
```

### Discussion {-#discussion-id086}

The `forecast` function will calculate the next few observations and their
standard errors according to the model. It returns a list with 10
elements. When we print the model, as we just did, `forecast` returns the time series points it is forecasting, the forecast, and two pairs of confidence bands: high/low 80% and high/low 95%.

If we want to extract out just the forecast, we can do that by assigning the results to an object, and then pulling out the list item named `mean`:
```{r}
fc_m <- forecast(m)
fc_m$mean
```

The result is a `Time-Series` object containing the forecasts created by the `forecast` function. 

Plotting a Forecast {#recipe-plotting_forecast}
------------------

### Problem {-#problem-plotting_forecast}

You have created a time series forecast with the `forecast` package and you would like to plot it. 

### Solution {-#solution-plotting_forecast}

Time series models created with the `forecast` package have a plotting method that uses `ggplot2` to create graphs easily, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:forecast1):

```{r forecast1, fig.cap='Forecast cone of uncertainty: Default'}
fc_m <- forecast(m)
autoplot(fc_m)
```

### Discussion {-#discussion-plotting_forecast}

The `autoplot` function makes a very reasonable figure, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:forecast1). Since the resulting figure is a `ggplot` object, we can adjust the plotting parameters the same way we would any other `ggplot` object. Here we add labels and a title and change the theme, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:forecast2):

```{r forecast2, fig.cap='Forecast cone of uncertainty: Labeled'}
autoplot(fc_m) +
  ylab("Euro Index") +
  xlab("Year/Quarter") +
  ggtitle("Forecasted Retail Index") +
  theme_bw()
```

Testing for Mean Reversion {#recipe-id087}
--------------------------

### Problem {-#problem-id087}

You want to know if your time series is mean reverting (stationary).

### Solution {-#solution-id087}

A common test for mean reversion is the Augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF)
test, which is implemented by the `adf.test` function of the `tseries`
package:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
library(tseries)
adf.test(ts)
```

The output from `adf.test` includes a *p*-value. Conventionally, if *p*
&lt; 0.05, the time series is likely mean reverting, whereas a *p*
&gt; 0.05 provides no such evidence.

### Discussion {-#discussion-id087}

When a time series is mean reverting, it tends to return to its long-run
average. It may wander off, but eventually it wanders back. If a time
series is not mean reverting, then it can wander away without ever
returning to the mean.

Figure \@ref(fig:goog200plot) appears to be wandering upward and not returning. The large *p*-value from the `adf.test` confirms that it is not mean reverting:

``` {r goog200plot, fig.cap='Time series without mean reversion'}
library(tseries)
library(fpp2)
autoplot(goog200)
adf.test(goog200)
```

The time series in Figure \@ref(fig:hsalesplot), however, is just bouncing around its average
value. The small *p*-value (0.012) confirms that it is mean reverting:

``` {r hsalesplot, fig.cap='Time series with mean reversion'}
autoplot(hsales)
adf.test(hsales)
```
The example data here comes from the `fpp2` package and comprises all `Time-Series` object types.
If your data were in a `zoo` or `xts` object, then you would need to call `coredata` to extract out the raw data from the object before passing it to `adf.test`:

```{r}
library(xts)
data(sample_matrix)
xts_obj <- as.xts(sample_matrix, dateFormat = "Date")[, "Close"] # single vector of data

adf.test(coredata(xts_obj))
```

The `adf.test` function massages your data before performing the ADF
test. First it automatically detrends your data, and then it recenters the
data, giving it a mean of 0.

If either detrending or recentering is undesirable for your application,
use the `adfTest` function in the `fUnitRoots` package instead:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
library(fUnitRoots)
adfTest(coredata(ts1), type = "nc")
```

With `type = "nc"`, the function neither detrends nor recenters your data.
With `type = "c"`, the function recenters your data but does not detrend
it.

Both the `adf.test` and the `adfTest` functions let you specify a lag
value that controls the exact statistic they calculate. These functions
provide reasonable defaults, but serious users should study the
textbook description of the ADF test to determine the appropriate lag
for their application.

### See Also {-#see_also-id087}

The `urca` and `CADFtest` packages also implement tests for a unit root,
which is the test for mean reversion. Be careful when comparing the
tests from several packages. Each package can make slightly different
assumptions, which can lead to puzzling differences in the results.

Smoothing a Time Series {#recipe-id195}
-----------------------

### Problem {-#problem-id195}

You have a noisy time series. You want to smooth the data to eliminate
the noise.

### Solution {-#solution-id195}

The `KernSmooth` package contains functions for smoothing. Use the
`dpill` function to select an initial bandwidth parameter, and then use the
`locploy` function to smooth the data:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
library(KernSmooth)

gridsize <- length(y)
bw <- dpill(t, y, gridsize = gridsize)
lp <- locpoly(x = t, y = y, bandwidth = bw, gridsize = gridsize)
smooth <- lp$y
```

Here, `t` is the time variable and `y` is the time series.

### Discussion {-#discussion-id195}

The `KernSmooth` package is a standard part of the R distribution. It
includes the `locpoly` function, which constructs, around each
data point, a polynomial that is fitted to the nearby data points.
These are called *local polynomials*. The local polynomials are strung
together to create a smoothed version of the original data series.

The algorithm requires a bandwidth parameter to control the degree of
smoothing. A small bandwidth means less smoothing, in which case the
result follows the original data more closely. A large bandwidth means
more smoothing, so the result contains less noise. The tricky part is
choosing just the right bandwidth: not too small, not too large.

Fortunately, `KernSmooth` also includes the function `dpill` for
estimating the appropriate bandwidth, and it works quite well.
We recommend that you start with the `dpill` value and then experiment with
values above and below that starting point. There is no magic formula
here. You need to decide what level of smoothing works best in your
application.

The following is an example of smoothing. We'll create some example data that is the sum of a simple sine wave and normally distributed “noise”:

``` {r }
t <- seq(from = -10, to = 10, length.out = 201)
noise <- rnorm(201)
y <- sin(t) + noise
```

Both `dpill` and `locpoly` require a grid size—in other words, the number of
points for which a local polynomial is constructed.
We often use a grid size equal to the number of data points, which yields a fine resolution.
The resulting time series is very smooth. You might use a smaller grid
size if you want a coarser resolution or if you have a very large
dataset:

``` {r, message=FALSE}
library(KernSmooth)
gridsize <- length(y)
bw <- dpill(t, y, gridsize = gridsize)
```

The `locpoly` function performs the smoothing and returns a list. The
`y` element of that list is the smoothed data:

``` {r smoothplot, fig.cap='Example time series plot'}
lp <- locpoly(x = t, y = y, bandwidth = bw, gridsize = gridsize)
smooth <- lp$y

ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = t, y = y)) +
  geom_line(aes(x = t, y = smooth), linetype = 2)
```

In Figure \@ref(fig:smoothplot), the smoothed data is shown
as a dashed line, while the solid line is our original example data. The figure demonstrates that `locpoly` did an
excellent job of extracting the original sine wave.

### See Also {-#see_also-id195}

The `ksmooth`, `lowess`, and `HoltWinters` functions in the base
distribution can also perform smoothing. The `expsmooth` package
implements exponential smoothing.
